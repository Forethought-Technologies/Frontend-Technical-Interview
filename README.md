## Prompt

This repository creates a navigation component. Above, you can see the mock design that the engineer was told to implement. We want to discuss the technical implementation taken to create the navigation component. Please feel free to discuss the implementation as you would when doing a code review from a technical standpoint purely. Please be explicit about good and bad practices and things you would change if any. We are looking to hear detailed explanations and your reasoning behind your decisions.
